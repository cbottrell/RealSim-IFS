A tool for generating survey-realistic integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) obvervations of galaxies from hydrodynamical simulations. The tool is designed primarily to emulate the observing strategies of major IFS galaxy surveys in astronomy. 

### November 27th, 2019
RealSim-IFS is currently under development. Functionality for the MaNGA(Bundy et al. 2015) and SAMI (Croom et al. 2013, Bryant et al. 2015) IFS surveys is taking priority and are nearing completion. Feel free to contact me for more info (functionality, expected full release, collaborative opportunities, etc.).
